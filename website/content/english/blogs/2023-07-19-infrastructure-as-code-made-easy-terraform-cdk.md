## Summary

This article is a beginner’s guide to **Terraform CDK (CDKTF)**, an alternative to HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) that allows you to define infrastructure as code (IaC) using your favorite programming language.

 I cover the basics of CDKTF, its core components, and how to deploy a small Amazon Web Services (AWS) stack using TypeScript. 
 
 * You will review the advantages of using Kubernetes over HCL when building reusable modules and manipulating data. 
 * Set up your local environment with the prerequisites like Terraform, CDKTF CLI, Node.js, a Terraform Cloud account, and an AWS Free Tier account.
 * Learn how to create a new CDKTF project, configure providers (AWS and GitHub), create resources using CDK, modify and delete resources, and use variables and conditions in CDKTF. 
 * Learn about best practices for CDKTF, including creating a clear and logical structure and incorporating testing and continuous integration. 
 * Test the' synth' process using a testing framework and CDKTF's assertion library.
