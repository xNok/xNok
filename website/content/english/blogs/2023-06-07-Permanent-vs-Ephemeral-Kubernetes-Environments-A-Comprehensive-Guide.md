## Summary

In this article, I explore the fundamental differences between **permanent** and **ephemeral Kubernetes environments**, providing a comprehensive guide to their respective advantages and disadvantages within the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. You will understand how **ephemeral environments**, empowered by **Kubernetes** and **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** tools, streamline development workflows. I also address the challenges and key considerations in adopting ephemeral environments, emphasizing their role in fostering **operational excellence** and **GitOps** practices. My goal is to equip you with the insights needed to make informed decisions for your software development projects.
