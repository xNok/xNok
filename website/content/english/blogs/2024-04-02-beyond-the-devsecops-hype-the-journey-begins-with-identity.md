## Summary

This article explores the core concepts of **Identity Management** in **DevSecOps** and their importance in ensuring secure software development. The article explores the historical evolution of identity, the three domains of Identity Management (**IAM**, **PAM**, **IGA**), and their connection to trust. By understanding these concepts, you will gain insights into building secure CI/CD pipelines and implementing proactive security measures. I confidently claim that out of three, two core concepts of identity management are rarely properly considered, but they are equally important!.
