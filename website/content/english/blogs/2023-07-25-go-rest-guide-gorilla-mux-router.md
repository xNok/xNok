## Summary

In this article, **I** will guide **you** through building a Golang REST API using the **Gorilla/Mux router**. **You**'ll explore how a router enhances request handling in REST APIs, reducing code compared to the standard library. 

Key points:

*   **Router Benefits:** **Routers** streamline request dispatch to handler functions, cutting down on repetitive code.
*   **gorilla/mux Features:** **You** will learn how to define routes, handle HTTP methods, implement subrouters, and utilize middleware.
*   **Practical Implementation:** **You**'ll construct a simple REST API, focusing on routers and exploring features like subrouters and middleware for reusable handler functionalities.

I hope this guide helps you improve your Go web development skills!
