In this guide, I'll walk you through building a REST API in Go using the **gorilla/mux** router. This tutorial is perfect for you if you're looking to move beyond the standard `net/http` package and want to handle HTTP requests more efficiently.

I'll cover the main advantages of using a router and demonstrate how to set up and configure **gorilla/mux**. You'll also learn about more advanced features like **subrouters** for better code organization and **middleware** for creating reusable components. This will help you write cleaner, more modular, and more scalable APIs.

By the end of this article, you'll have a solid understanding of how to build a REST API with **gorilla/mux** and be able to apply these concepts to your own projects.
