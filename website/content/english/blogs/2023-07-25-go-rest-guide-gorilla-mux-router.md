## Summary

In this article, I guide you through building a Golang REST API using the **gorilla/mux router**. You will explore how a router enhances request handling in REST APIs, significantly reducing repetitive code compared to the standard library. I will introduce you to the powerful features of the **gorilla/mux** library, demonstrating how to define routes, manage different HTTP methods, and implement **subrouters** and **middleware**. By following this guide, you will gain a solid understanding of developing REST APIs with the **gorilla/mux** router, thereby improving your Go web development skills.

## Key Concepts

*   **Router Benefits:** Routers streamline HTTP request dispatch to handler functions, minimizing code duplication.
*   **`gorilla/mux` Features:** Learn to define routes, handle HTTP methods, and implement subrouters and middleware for efficient API development.
*   **Practical Implementation:** I will show you how to build a basic REST API, focusing on router setup and the creation of handlers for common operations (Create, List, Get, Update, Delete).
*   **Subrouters:** Discover how subrouters can logically group routes (e.g., all `/recipes` endpoints) to enhance code organization and router performance.
*   **Middleware:** Understand how middleware functions between the router and handlers, allowing for reusable functionalities like authentication and logging. **gorilla/mux** simplifies middleware application to multiple handlers with its `Use()` function.
