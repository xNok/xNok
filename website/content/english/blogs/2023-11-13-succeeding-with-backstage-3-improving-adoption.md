## Summary

This article, the third in the “Succeeding with Backstage” series, provides key strategies for improving **Backstage adoption** within your organization. I will guide you through implementing systematic approaches to help developers unlock the platform's full value, emphasize the importance of establishing a **dedicated team** for custom plugin development and maintenance, and explore effective internal **marketing techniques** such as team restructuring and cross-pollination through demos and hackathons. Additionally, I will highlight the critical role of a well-structured **onboarding experience** and continuous engagement activities in ensuring Backstage's long-term success as an integral part of your **developer experience**.

## Key Concepts

*   **Guiding Developers to Unlock Value:** Implement a systematic approach, starting with core features and gradually introducing more complex functionalities like annotations. This "gamified" approach encourages **discovery learning**. Tailored **onboarding paths**, such as [Onboarding Software to Backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/onboarding-software) and [Backstage for All](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/backstage-for-all), can further facilitate this process.
*   **Dedicated Team for Custom Plugins:** Establish a central team responsible for Backstage operations, custom plugin development (requiring **TypeScript** and **React** skills), and ongoing maintenance. This team also facilitates **inner sourcing** and leverages the wider Backstage community for enhancements. Crucially, they monitor **Backstage usage and adoption** through KPIs and tools like the Google Analytics, Pulse, and Soundcheck plugins.
*   **Internal Marketing:** Employ strategies like **Dynamic Reteaming** by Heidi Helfand, which involves mixing and merging teams to promote knowledge sharing and mentorship. Utilize **cross-pollination** through company-wide demos, following the **Tell, Show, Do, and Review** method. Organize **hackathons** or game days to encourage developer contributions and foster a sense of ownership over the platform.
*   **Onboarding Experience:** Continuously refine the onboarding process for new employees, ensuring they receive a proper introduction to Backstage, including how to access information, identify teams, and launch new projects using software templates. Reinforce engagement through recurring discussions like **fireside chats** (using the [Lean Coffee](https://leancoffee.org/) approach) and organized talks, both internal and external.
