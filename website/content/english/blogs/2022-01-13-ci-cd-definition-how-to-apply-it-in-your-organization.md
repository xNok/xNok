In my article, I explore the concept of **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** and its practical application within an organization. I distinguish between **continuous delivery** and **continuous deployment**, clarifying the nuances of each approach.

The piece delves into the foundational practices that underpin a successful CI/CD strategy. I emphasize the importance of **redefining infrastructure**, adopting a **self-service model**, and embracing a **fail-fast** philosophy to accelerate learning and improvement.

Furthermore, I outline the critical steps for building an effective **feedback loop**, a cornerstone of CI/CD that ensures quality and responsiveness. The journey toward continuous deployment is presented as a progressive path, one that unlocks fast and reliable software delivery.

For those looking to implement these practices, I offer expert advice on setting up robust CI/CD pipelines, drawing from my own experiences to help you navigate the complexities of modern software development.
