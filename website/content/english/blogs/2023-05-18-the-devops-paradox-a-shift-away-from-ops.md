In my latest article, I delve into the **DevOps Paradox**, exploring its evolution from a collaborative culture between **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)** to a paradigm where Ops is increasingly sidelined. I trace this shift back to the rise of **cloud computing** and the proliferation of **as-a-Service** models (**IaaS, PaaS, SaaS**), which have largely automated and abstracted away the traditional responsibilities of Ops.

This has led to the emergence of the **"DevOps engineer"**, a role that often focuses on maintaining the very tools designed to simplify software integration and deployment, effectively creating a new kind of silo. While DevOps has championed valuable principles like **"shift left"** and **"you build it, you run it,"** and has been instrumental in the widespread adoption of **Continuous Delivery**, the complexity of the modern toolchain (as illustrated by the **CNCF Landscape**) presents its own set of challenges.

I also touch on the irony that while DevOps was meant to break down silos, it has paradoxically led to the removal of Ops from the equation, a trend that continues with derivatives like **DevSecOps, FinOps, and GitOps**. I invite you to read the [Original Article](https to explore this fascinating evolution and its implications for the future of software engineering.
