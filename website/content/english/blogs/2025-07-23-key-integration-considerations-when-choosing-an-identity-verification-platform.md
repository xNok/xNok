> Original Article: [Key Integration Considerations When Choosing an Identity Verification Platform](https://www.prove.com/blog/id-verification-platforms)

## Summary

This article outlines the crucial **integration considerations** when selecting an **Identity Verification (IDV) platform**. It emphasizes that seamless integration is paramount for a quick **time-to-market** and reduced **maintenance costs**.

I learned that a key aspect of an effective IDV platform is its **API design** and **developer experience**. While various API styles exist, **REST APIs** are generally preferred for SaaS integrations due to their widespread understanding and simplicity. Important API features include **idempotency** and **retry mechanisms** to handle failed requests and prevent data duplication, especially with asynchronous processes that rely on **webhooks**.

Furthermore, the article highlights the significance of **SDK quality** and **client-side support**. A robust SDK should abstract away complex API interactions and offer prebuilt methods for common operations, such as handling authentication, errors, and retries. Platforms that provide prebuilt UI components for client-side IDV integration can significantly reduce development overhead.

**Security integration** is another critical area. Client-side workflows and asynchronous webhook callbacks require specific security measures, such as integration with existing authentication mechanisms like **OAuth 2.0**, **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**, or **SAML**, and **signature verification** for webhook authenticity.

For modern architectures, the platform should be compatible with **serverless and edge functions**, offering strong retry policies to mitigate issues like cold starts. In **event-driven systems**, using a dedicated ingress service or API gateway to authenticate webhooks before sending them to a message bus is the recommended approach.

Finally, the article addresses **scalability concerns** for **multi-tenant** and **global applications**, stressing the need for tenant-aware APIs and support for **data residency** to comply with regulations like GDPR. It also underscores the importance of **testing and DevOps**, advocating for detailed API specifications (Swagger/OAS), mock APIs, high-fidelity sandbox environments, and automated test suites. Post-integration, it is vital to review **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**, establish clear communication channels with the vendor, and ensure access to **logs and metrics** for effective monitoring.

## Key Concepts

*   **Integration as a Critical Priority:** Emphasis on seamless integration for fast time-to-market and reduced maintenance costs.
*   **API Design & Developer Experience:** Importance of clear API design, REST API preference, idempotency, retry mechanisms, and asynchronous webhooks.
*   **SDK Quality & Client-Side Support:** Value of robust SDKs, comprehensive language support, public SDKs, and customizable prebuilt UI components.
*   **Security Integration:** Securing client-side workflows (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML) and webhook callbacks (token-based authentication, signature verification).
*   **Compatibility with Modern Architectures:** Handling serverless/edge functions (retry policies for cold starts), event-driven systems (ingress service for webhooks), multi-tenancy (tenant-aware APIs), and global applications (data residency, GDPR, SOC 2 certification).
*   **Testing & DevOps:** Need for detailed API specifications (Swagger/OAS), mock APIs, high-fidelity sandbox environments, and automated test suites.
*   **Operational Considerations Post-Integration:** Reviewing SLAs, communication channels with vendors, and access to logs/metrics.
