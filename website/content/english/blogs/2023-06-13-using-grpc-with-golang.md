## Summary

This article explores how to work with the **gRPC** (**Remote Procedure Call**) framework with **Golang** for microservice communication, offering performance gains over REST APIs. **gRPC** utilizes HTTP/2 protocol, offering header compression, multiplexing, persistent TCP connections, and binary format support with protocol buffers, resulting in faster and more efficient communication. The article guides you through implementing a simple client-server application in Go. You'll create a service that can save and load notes, utilizing the code generated by `protoc`. The tutorial also touches on implementing streaming with gRPC. 


### Key Concepts

*   **gRPC (Remote Procedure Call)**: A framework for building fast and efficient APIs.  
*   **Protocol Buffers**: A language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.
*   **HTTP/2**: The underlying protocol used by gRPC, offering performance enhancements.
