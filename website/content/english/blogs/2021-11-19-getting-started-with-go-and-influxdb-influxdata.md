## Summary

This article guides you through integrating **InfluxDB**, a high-performance time-series database, with a **Go** application. You'll learn how to set up a local **InfluxDB** instance using Docker, establish connections using the **Go** client library, and perform data insertions and queries. The tutorial covers data modeling, insertion methods, and querying techniques for a temperature monitoring application. By following this guide, you can gain a solid understanding of how to use **InfluxDB** with **Go** for managing time-series data.

This tutorial covers:

*   Setting up InfluxDB with Docker.
*   Connecting to InfluxDB using the Go client library.
*   Modeling data for time-series storage.
*   Inserting data using line protocol, data points with constructors, and fluent style.
*   Querying data using [Flux](https://www.influxdata.com/products/flux/) scripting language.
