Original article: [Superheroes — Themed Scrum Retrospective](https://medium.com/agileinsider/superheros-themed-scrum-retrospective-ea988b4d14e1)

This blog post summarizes an article about using a **superhero-themed Scrum retrospective** to boost team engagement and creativity. I found that by structuring the retrospective around the **FLAP** method (**Future directions, Lessons learned, Accomplishments, Problem areas**), and using speech balloons to highlight key insights, the retrospective can be more effective.

The article suggests starting with a creative warmup: each team member introduces themself as a superhero, sharing their role, strengths, and weaknesses. The main activity then explores the FLAP quadrants, using **superhero memes** and **speech bubbles** to capture main takeaways.

I think you can use this approach to make your team's retrospective sessions more enjoyable and productive.
