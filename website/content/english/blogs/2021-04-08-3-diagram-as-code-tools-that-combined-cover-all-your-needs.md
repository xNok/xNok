## Summary

This article explores three **diagram-as-code tools** that can cover all your needs as an engineer:

*   **Diagrams**: a Python library (and Golang implementation) for creating infrastructure diagrams.
*   **PlantUML**:  a tool to generate UML diagrams, especially sequence diagrams, with a VS Code extension.
*   **Draw.io**: A flexible diagramming tool that can be used directly in VS Code, allowing for quick and easy diagram creation.

The author advocates for creating diagrams as code to improve team collaboration, document code, and visualize dependencies. They recommend creating diagrams at the beginning of a story, during pair programming, or during the Three Amigos process.

## Update 

I have since revised my position on the subject and only use two [PlantUML & Excalidraw](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-create-all-your-diagrams-with-the-power-of-code-f09518125702)
