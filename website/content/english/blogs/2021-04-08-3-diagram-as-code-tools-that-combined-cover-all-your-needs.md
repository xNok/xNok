[Original Article](https://medium.com/geekculture/3-diagram-as-code-tools-that-combined-cover-all-your-needs-8f40f57d5cd8)

## Summary

The article emphasizes the crucial role of **diagrams as code** in enhancing an engineer's communication and collaboration skills. I explore three powerful tools that, when combined, can fulfill all your diagramming needs: **Diagrams** (for infrastructure visualization in Python and Go), **PlantUML** (ideal for creating UML, especially sequence diagrams, with a VS Code extension), and **Draw.io** (a flexible tool for quick diagrams, also with a VS Code extension).

I advocate for creating diagrams to conceptualize complex projects, bridge communication gaps between developers and business, visualize dependencies, and onboard new team members. I suggest integrating diagram creation at the start of a story, during pair programming sessions, or as part of the Three Amigos process to foster clear communication and efficient code.
