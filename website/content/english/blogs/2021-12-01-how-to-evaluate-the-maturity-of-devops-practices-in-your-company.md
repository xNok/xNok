## Summary

In this article, I will introduce you to the **SMART Maturity Assessment Method**, a Lean Manufacturing methodology adapted for evaluating the maturity of **DevOps practices** within your company. This approach helps to create a roadmap for continuous improvement. The **SMART** acronym represents five levels of maturity, guiding organizations from initial adoption to becoming a transformed organization that shares best practices internally and externally along the complete value chain. You'll discover the four phases involved in conducting a **SMART assessment**: understanding the direction of change, grasping the current situation, establishing the next target, and executing the plan. I truly think this is a very simple tool yet really powerful.
