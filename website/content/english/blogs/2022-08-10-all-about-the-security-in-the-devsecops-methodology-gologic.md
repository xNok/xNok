## Summary

This article introduces the concept of **DevSecOps** as a necessary evolution of DevOps, emphasizing the integration of **security** practices into the software development lifecycle. It addresses the increasing need for security in light of recent significant security breaches and explains how DevSecOps aims to balance the speed and reliability of software delivery with robust security measures. The article highlights that security should be a shared responsibility across development, QA, and operations teams, facilitated by automation tools and well-defined governance policies. It also suggests a shift-left approach to security, where security assessments are conducted early and often in the development process. The goal is to equip DevOps teams with the ability to defend against digital attacks by automating security tasks and integrating security checks into the CI/CD pipeline.
