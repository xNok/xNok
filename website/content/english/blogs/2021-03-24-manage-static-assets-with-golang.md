## Summary

In this article, I explore how to manage static assets in **Golang** applications using the new `embed` package introduced in version 1.16. This **package** simplifies the process of embedding files directly into your application binary. I find this feature particularly useful for handling resources like **JSON** payloads for **SlackBot** messages. The article provides insights into creating and rendering customizable messages using **Block-kit**, and I discuss the advantages of this approach for building efficient Slack applications. You will learn how the `embed` package offers a convenient solution for keeping static content within a single binary.

## Key Concepts

*   **Golang embed Package:** A new feature in Golang 1.16 that allows embedding files and directories into the application binary.
*   **Static Assets Management:** Efficiently manage static assets such as JSON files, templates, and other resources.
*   **SlackBot Development:** Creating and managing customizable messages for Slack applications using Block-kit.
*   **Block-kit Builder:** A tool to design and create Slack message layouts using JSON payloads.
