This blog post summarizes the article [Using gRPC with Golang - Speedscale](https://speedscale.com/2022/05/03/using-grpc-with-golang/).

In this article, I explored how to use **gRPC** with **Golang** for **microservice communication** by building a simple note-taking application. I learned the advantages of **gRPC** over **REST**, understood its structure and components, and implemented both a **gRPC** server and client. By the end, I had a solid grasp of how to create efficient, action-based APIs using **gRPC** and the benefits of leveraging **protocol buffers** for data representation.
