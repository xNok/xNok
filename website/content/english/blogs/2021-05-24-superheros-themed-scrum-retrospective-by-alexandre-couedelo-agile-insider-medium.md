[Original Article: Superheroes — Themed Scrum Retrospective | by Alexandre Couëdelo | Agile Insider | Medium](https://medium.com/agileinsider/superheros-themed-scrum-retrospective-ea988b4d14e1)

In this article, **I** present a **superhero**-themed approach to spice up your Scrum retrospectives. This theme is designed to foster **creativity** and engagement within the team.

The retrospective framework includes:

*   A warmup activity: Team members introduce themselves as **superheroes**, highlighting their **strengths** and **weaknesses**.
*   Gathering data using the **FLAP** method (**Future** directions, **Lessons** learned, **Accomplishments**, **Problem** areas), enhanced with superhero-themed memes and speech bubbles.
*   Concluding with action items derived from speech bubble discussions.

By using a superhero theme, **you** can encourage teams to think more creatively and consider situations from different angles. The article provides practical tips, such as using superhero league membership cards and comic-style speech bubbles, to implement this approach effectively. **I** think you will have fun with this one, its always good to inject new ideas into your agile practices.
