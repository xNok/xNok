## Summary

This article introduces a creative approach to **Scrum retrospectives** by using a **superhero theme** to boost team engagement and creativity. I present a structured retrospective agenda that includes a **warm-up activity** where team members create their superhero personas, and the **FLAP (Future directions, Lessons learned, Accomplishments, Problem areas) method** to generate insights. The article uses **speech balloons** to capture key takeaways and actions. You will learn how to conduct a **themed retrospective** that will make your team's retrospective sessions more enjoyable and effective by thinking outside the box.
