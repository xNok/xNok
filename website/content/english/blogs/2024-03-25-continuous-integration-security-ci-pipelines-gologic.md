[Original Article](https://www.gologic.ca/en/continuous-integration-security/)

I've updated my summary of the Gologic article on Continuous Integration (CI) security. The key takeaway is the importance of a two-pronged approach: securing the CI system itself and ensuring the software you build is secure.

To do this, I learned about a few key practices. First, using **Static Code Analysis (SAST)** to scan my own code for vulnerabilities. Second, creating a **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** to check all the third-party libraries and dependencies I use for known security issues. Finally, I've adopted the **principle of least privilege** for the CI system itself. This means each pipeline gets only the permissions it absolutely needs, which minimizes the potential damage if a secret is ever compromised.

By focusing on these areas, I can build a more secure and resilient software delivery process.
