## Summary

This article delves into **automating GitHub environment configuration** using **Terraform**, a key practice for streamlining **deployment workflows** within **GitHub Actions**. It highlights the significant advantages of leveraging GitHub environments, specifically their ability to facilitate **environment-specific variable** definitions, enforce robust **protection rules** to prevent unauthorized deployments, and maintain a comprehensive **deployment history**.

I demonstrate the practical steps involved, including setting up the **GitHub Terraform provider** and authenticating securely with a **personal access token**. The article guides you through the process of provisioning **secrets** into GitHub environments using Terraform, emphasizing best practices for managing sensitive information (with a note on the benefits of Terraform Cloud for state file security). Furthermore, I explain how to configure **branch protection rules** and implement **deployment reviewers** to introduce crucial manual approval steps, ensuring controlled and secure deployments.

This integration of Terraform with GitHub is presented as a method to significantly reduce manual interventions and enhance the security posture of your **CI/CD pipelines**. This work is part of a larger series focused on self-hosted projects using Terraform, Ansible, and GitHub.

## Key Concepts

*   **GitHub Environments**: A feature in GitHub Actions to manage and track provisioning and deployment workflows, offering environment-specific variables, protection rules, and deployment history.
*   **Terraform GitHub Provider**: Used to automate the configuration of GitHub repositories and environments, including provisioning secrets and setting branch protection rules.
*   **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Used for authentication with GitHub APIs via Terraform. (Note: GitHub Apps are recommended for enhanced security in production).
*   **Deployment Reviewers**: A feature to add a manual approval step to workflows, useful for reviewing Terraform plans before application or for trunk-based development.
*   **Branch Protection Rules**: Enforce best practices like requiring pull requests, workflow validations, and preventing force pushes for deployment branches.
