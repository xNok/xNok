## Summary

This article explores the **Security Champions Program**, a strategic initiative designed to foster collaboration between security, development, and operations teams within a **DevSecOps culture**. It addresses the imbalance of security experts to developers by empowering individuals within development teams to act as **security advocates**. These champions are trained to identify vulnerabilities, promote secure coding practices, and facilitate communication between security and development. The article details their responsibilities, which include training and coaching, staying up-to-date on best practices, fostering cooperation, and enhancing security initiatives. It also outlines key selection criteria for champions, emphasizing the importance of **technical experience**, **leadership qualities**, **strong communication skills**, and an existing **security interest**. The program aims to build a community around security, ensuring continuous improvement and proactive defense throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Key Concepts

*   **Security Champions Program:** A program run by the security team to improve the company's security posture by selecting and training individuals within development teams to act as security advocates.
*   **Responsibilities of Security Champions:** Training and coaching, staying up to date on best practices, cooperation between teams, and enhancing security by participating in security-related projects.
*   **Selecting Security Champions:** Criteria include relevant technical experience (e.g., 2+ years in the company), leadership qualities, strong communication skills, and existing security interest. Nominations from development teams are also encouraged.
*   **Program Activities:** Monthly training, security days/conferences, hackathons, certifications (e.g., CSSLP), and book clubs/discussion panels to build a security community.
