## Summary
This article explores the **Security Champions Program**, a strategic initiative designed to foster collaboration between **security**, **development**, and **operations** teams within a **DevSecOps culture**. It discusses the roles and responsibilities of **security champions**, the criteria for selecting them, and the activities that promote a security-conscious environment. The program aims to address the imbalance of security experts to developers by empowering individuals within development teams to act as security advocates. These champions are trained to identify vulnerabilities, promote secure coding practices, and serve as liaisons between the security team and developers, fostering continuous improvement and proactive defense.
