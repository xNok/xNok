## Summary

This article explains the role of a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** and its relation to **DevOps**. I learned about the responsibilities and daily routine of an **SRE**, and the importance of **SLOs** (Service Level Objectives) in ensuring reliable software delivery. The article also gave insights into the collaboration between development and operations teams in the **SRE** model and how it contributes to maintaining a high-quality production environment. The **SRE** model was created at Google in 2003. The one and only “official” responsibility of an **SRE** is to ensure that the system is reliable, meaning that the company meets its objectives translated in **SLA** (service level agreement).

## Key concepts

* SREs primary responsibility is to ensure system reliability, meeting objectives defined in SLAs.
* SREs use SLOs and SLIs to measure system performance.
* SREs spend time improving tooling and monitoring systems.
* SREs act as gatekeepers for production environments and participate early in product development.
* The SRE model differs from DevOps by separating development and operations while fostering collaboration.
* SREs translate technical data into business insights and manage the software supply chain
