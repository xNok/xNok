## Summary

The article "Choosing the right DevOps training" emphasizes the crucial need for IT professionals to stay updated in the rapidly evolving DevOps landscape. It guides you through a structured approach to choosing the most suitable **DevOps training** based on your current knowledge and career aspirations.

To begin your journey, I recommend focusing on foundational knowledge. Reading key books like **The DevOps Handbook**, **The Unicorn Project**, and **Accelerate** by Gene Kim and Jez Humble will provide you with a solid understanding of DevOps principles, including its four pillars: **Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing**. If you prefer a structured learning environment, the **DevOps Foundation®** certification from the DevOps Institute is an excellent starting point.

Next, you should strengthen your core DevOps practices. This includes mastering **Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment** (CI/CD pipelines), along with **Automation and Pipeline as Code**. Developing skills in **Monitoring and Retroaction**, often aligned with the **SRE model**, is also crucial for effective troubleshooting in production. Cloud provider certifications from AWS, GCP, or Azure can help solidify these foundational skills.

Finally, to become a **DevOps expert**, the article suggests specializing in a specific role, using resources like [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) for guidance. Continuous learning through online classes on platforms like [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), and by reading blog posts from sources such as [draft.dev](https://draft.dev), [Medium](https://medium.com/), and [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/), is highly recommended for acquiring new technical skills and tools. For specialized expertise, pursuing advanced certifications, especially in **Kubernetes** like the **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** or **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)**, will significantly enhance your profile.

In conclusion, I believe that choosing the right DevOps training involves a strategic plan centered on foundational knowledge, core practices, and continuous personal development to achieve specialized expertise and stay ahead in this dynamic field.
