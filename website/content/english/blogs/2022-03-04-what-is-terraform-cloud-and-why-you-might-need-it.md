## Summary

This article explains **Terraform Cloud**, a platform that helps you manage and automate your **infrastructure as code (IaC)**. You'll discover its key features, including **collaboration**, **automation**, and **consistency** across cloud environments. The article emphasizes the benefits of using Terraform Cloud to streamline infrastructure management and improve team workflows. It also touches on how Terraform Cloud enables you to maintain version control, track changes, and enforce policies for your infrastructure.

## Key Concepts

*   **Terraform Cloud**: A Terraform based HashiCorp platform for managing and automating infrastructure as code.
## Update

I have since moved away from Terraform Cloud. While the workflow they offer is rather good in practice, it was too much more practical to have Ansible run my Terraform workflows since the end goal is to provision the VM created in the process.
