As a technical writer, I've learned that **visuals** are not just a nice-to-have; they are essential for creating engaging and effective content. In this article, I want to share with you my journey of discovering the best visuals for technical content and why they work.

I used to rely on generic stock photos, but I soon realized they did little to enhance my articles. I decided to explore different visual styles to find what would best complement my writing. I experimented with various types of visuals, from **infographics** to **stick figures** and **hand-drawn illustrations**. Each style has its strengths and weaknesses, and the key is to choose the one that best fits your content and personal brand.

For those who are not artistically inclined, **structured diagrams** like **flowcharts** and **UML diagrams** are a great option. They are easy to create with tools like **PlantUML** and **Mermaid**, and they are incredibly effective at explaining complex technical concepts.

I've also found that using a consistent visual style can help you build a recognizable brand. For example, I've been using a mix of hand-drawn illustrations and structured diagrams in my articles, which has helped me create a unique and personal touch.

To help you on your journey, I've compiled a list of my favorite tools and resources for creating visuals. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a beginner, I hope this article will inspire you to create more engaging and effective visuals for your technical content.
