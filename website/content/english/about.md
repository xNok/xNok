I am a seasoned DevOps/Platform Engineer, or as I prefer to call it, a **Software Supply Chain Automation Specialist**.

In essence, my work is centred on Developer Experience; I build the tools, frameworks, and best practices that empower engineers to ship features with speed, reliability and security.

My expertise spans three distinctive domains:

* Software Infrastructure: Setting up Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, GCP)
* Software Engineering: Software development (Dev) and Software Supply Chain (Ops)
* System Engineering: Decision-making, functional analysis, and applied mathematics.

I am also a productive technical writer with a few hundred articles in my portfolio. I love sharing my passion for everything related to DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, Kubernetes, and programming in Python and Golang.

Let's connect and explore opportunities for collaboration in refining software delivery, enhancing operations, and addressing engineering challenges.
